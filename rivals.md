## 📡 **THE OPPOSITION: THE DISINFORMATION**

> "We win when you stop caring."
> 

---

### 🧠 **Overview**

The Disinformation aren’t just a team—they’re a *signal collapse*. A weaponized barrage of clickbait, faux-expertise, and algorithmically optimized half-truths.

Some say they were designed in an NSA blacksite, others say they *emerged* from the detritus of a 24-hour news cycle and bad forum moderation.

> They don’t lie. They jam your ability to tell what’s true.
>

### 🧢 **Coach: Dr. Poindexter**

- Former *Adjunct Lecturer in Hypermedia Semiotics & Weaponized Metaphor*
- Wears six sets of glasses. None help.
- Speaks in riddles layered in footnotes
- Has a fake podcast about "dissecting the discourse around discourse"

> “We’re not running a play. We’re questioning the assumption that a play can be run.”
> 

“You must distinguish between the audiences, you must distinguish between deception and disinformation” -Poindexter

### 🏟️ **Home Field: THE FEEDBACK LOOP**

- **Stadium Environment**: Flashing ticker tape, voiceover loops, ambient commentary layered with old memes
- **Jumbotron**: Only shows reaction videos of the previous play
- **Field**: Artificial turf, but each blade of grass has a contradictory fact printed on it
- **Mascot**: An amorphous blur named “Consensus” that never quite resolves

---

### 🎽 **Uniform**

- **Base Color**: Discordant neon gradients (often shifting live)
- **Jersey Front**: Random trending hashtags overlaid with “*NO CONTEXT*”
- **Pants**: neon camoflage
- **Helmet**: Reflective, emits muffled K-pop under pressure
- **Gloves**: Each finger reads a different poll result
- **Cleats**: One Air Jordan, one Croc
- **Flair Patches**: Always contradictory (e.g., “Truth Matters” next to “Nothing Is Real”)
- **Backplate Text**: Often says things like *“SOURCE?”*, *“Just Asking Questions”*, or *“Did You Know?”*

---

### 💣 **Tactics**

- **Playbook**: Quantum—no two pages agree
- **Snap Count**: Always off-tempo, sometimes in binary
- **Formations**: Disorienting; may start with 12 players, end with 9
- **Special Play**: *The Reversal*: If you call them out, they counter by claiming they never said that and you’re misinterpreting
- **Emotion Control**: Weaponizes player frustration to destabilize team cohesion

### 🧠 **Notable Players**

> “Obey. Display. Disarm. Deny.”
> 

---

### 🧬 **Gameplay Style**

- Zero audibles. All plays pre-synced via encrypted wristbands
- No celebrations. Instead, players “report for alignment” after scoring
- Referee “accidents” always seem to go their way
- Their safeties bait you into trust. Then sell you out on a slant route

---

### ⚠️ **Cultural Hazard**

- **They don’t just beat you. They make you doubt your own choices.**
- Players who lose to the Narcs often spiral—wondering if they were complicit in their own defeat

---

Let me know if you want:

- A uniform visual (mirror helmet, silver-piped everything)
- A pre-game confrontation scene between Dex and Jettson
- Or a locker room moment where the Plateaus hear *the alignment chant* and go ice cold

The Narcs are the trauma in a tidy playbook. Let's make sure the Plateaus show them what healing looks like—with teeth.
